# ImageAI (v3.0.3)

[![Build Status](https://github.com/WingsDavis) 

This code uses OpenCV to load an image, create a circular mask, and apply the mask to the image to crop it to a rectangular shape.

Built with simplicity in mind, **Getting to know why Camera Lens is round but outputs in a Square** 
    supports OpenCV

**Historical Reason**
In the early days of photography, cameras used circular lenses because they were easier to manufacture and provided a larger image circle, which is the area where the light is focused onto the sensor or film. The circular shape also helped to reduce distortion and vignetting (darkening of the image corners).

**Technical reason**
A circular lens can project a circular image onto the sensor or film, but the sensor or film itself is typically rectangular or square in shape. This is because it's more efficient to manufacture and handle rectangular or square sensors or film, rather than circular ones. As a result, the circular image projected by the lens is cropped to fit the rectangular or square shape of the sensor or film, resulting in a rectangular or square image.

**Practical reason**
Using a rectangular or square shape for images has several practical advantages:

Easier to print and display: 
Rectangular or square images are easier to print and display, as they can be easily mounted on a rectangular or square surface.
More efficient use of space: 
Rectangular or square images make more efficient use of space, allowing for more images to be stored or displayed in a given area.
Better suited for composition: 
The rectangular or square shape of images allows for more creative freedom in composition, as it provides a clear top, bottom, left, and right edge for framing and balancing elements within the image.

Camera sensor and aspect ratio: Modern camera sensors are designed to capture images in a specific aspect ratio, which is the ratio of the image's width to its height. The most common aspect ratios are 3:2, 4:3, and 16:9. The camera's aspect ratio, combined with the circular lens, determines the final shape of the image.
